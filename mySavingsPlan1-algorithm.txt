1. Objective: calculate how much money to save every month for number of years before retirement and how much money would you have when you retire.

2. Requirements: 
--INPUT
deposit = author selected amount (for example $10, $100, etc.)
interestRate = author selects annual interest rate (for example 0.075 is 7.5%)

--PROCESSING
1. data definitions
2. user introduction
3. calculate amount of money to save every month
interestRate = interestRate / 12
time = years * 12
amountSaved = deposit * ((pow(1 + interestRate, time) - 1) / interestRate)
4. output results


--OUTPUT
-user introduction: objective, author, user instructions (if any)
-label "In "
-years
label " years at "
-interestRate
label "%, $"
-deposit
label " deposited per month will grow to $
-amountSaved formatted to 2 digits past the decimal point

--DATA
deposit-->> how much money you will add to your savings account each month (integer)
interestRate-->> annual interest rate you can expect (check google.com: for example 0.04 is 4%) (decimal)
years-->> how many more years until you retire (integer)
amountSaved-->> how much money you have when you retire (decimal) (formatted to 2 digits past decimal point)
time-->>number of months in years (integer)

3. Algorithm Instructions
***data definitions
10 set years = how many more years until you retire 
20 set deposit = how much $ to be saved each month
30 set interestRate = expected interest rate on deposit expressed as a number between 0 and 1
40 set interestRate = interestRate / 12
50 set time = years * 12
*** user introduction
60 output the user introduction (objective, author, and any user instructions)
*** calculate amount of money to save every month
70 set amountSaved = deposit * ((((1 + interestRate) ^ time) - 1) / interestRate)
80 set interestRate = (interestRate * 100) * 12
***output results
90 output "In " and years and " years at " and interestRate and "%, $" and deposit and " deposited per month will grow to $" and amountSaved
100 END

4. Test Cases
Test Case #1: purpose: example test case
              input values: years=10, interestRate=7.5%, investment=$100
       expected output: "In 10 years at 7.5% , $100 deposited per month will grow to $17793.03."
