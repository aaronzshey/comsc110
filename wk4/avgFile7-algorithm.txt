1. Objective: find maximum score, minimum score, average score, and number of scores greater than average of all the scores from input file

2. Requirements:
INPUT:

-each score from the input file

PROCESSING:
1. data
2. introduction
3. get input filename from user
4. determine how many scores are in the input file for storing the values
5. input values from input file
6. calculate the average score
7. find highest score
8. find lowest score

OUTPUT: 
-objective
-author
-prompt the user for input file name
-if count = 0 then output error message "Sorry, ", fileName, " is empty."
-label "The scores from the file ", fileName, " are: "
-each score from the input file
-label "The average of ", count, " scores is: "
-averageScore
-label "The highest score is: "
-maxScore
-label "The lowest score is: "

-nGreater

DATA:
-fileName (text) = input file name
-line (text) = a line from the input file
-averageScore (decimal) = calculated average of all the scores from the input file
-count (integer) = number of scores in the input file
-totalScores (integer) = sum of all the scores in the input file
-maxScore (integer) = highest score of all the scores in the input file
-minScore (integer) = lowest score of all the scores in the input file
-nGreater (integer) = number of scores greater than the average score
-i (integer) = indice for traversing each element in the array
-scores (dynamic array) = holds all the scores read from the input file, each score is betwen 0-100

Test case #2: input file is empty
If the input file is empty, the outputs are recorded as blank

Test case #3: input file not there
If the input files are empty, the outputs are also recorded as blank

Test case #4: only 1 score in the input file
If there is only 1 score, the program runs as normal.  

****When translating this algorithm into a program for our COMSC-110-8215 course class exercise: ***
1. determine how many scores are in the input file
2. create a dynamically sized array for that many scores
3. use a void function to input the scores with an input parameter of 
the dynamically sized array
4. use a value returning function to calculate the average score
5. use a value returning function to calculate the number of scores 
greater than the average
6. use a value returning function to find the highest score
7. use a value returning function to find the lowest score
